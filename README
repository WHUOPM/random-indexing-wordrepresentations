random-indexing-wordrepresentations
-----------------------------------

    by Joseph Turian

Induce word representations using random indexing (RI).

For information about random indexing, see:
    http://www.sics.se/~mange/random_indexing.html

You can control the hyperparameters by editing
    hyperparameters.random-indexing.yaml
Or you can control the hyperparameters using command-line options.

Another implementation (in Java) is semanticvectors:
    http://code.google.com/p/semanticvectors/


This code is based upon my neural language model code
(http://github.com/turian/neural-language-model), so it shares similar
idioms for the data it expects. For example, instead of building a
vocabulary on-the-fly, we assume that the vocabulary has been preextracted
and will be read in. Also, we assume that there is one-sentence-per-line
in the training input.
