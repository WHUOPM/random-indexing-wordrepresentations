# Contexts is a list of lists. For example [[-2, -1], [+1, +2]]. This
# means that words two to the left (-2) and one to the left (-1) of the
# focus word will be treated as one kind of context vector. Similarly,
# words one to the right (+1) and two to the right (+2) of the focus word
# are another kind of context vector.
contexts: [[-1], [+1]]
